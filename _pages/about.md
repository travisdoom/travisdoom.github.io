## Bio

Travis Doom (he/him/his) joins the Faculty at the University of Michigan (U-M) in Fall 2025.

Prior to joining U-M, Dr. Doom served as Professor and Associate Dean of the College of Engineering & Computer Science at Wright State University (WSU). Dr. Doom joined the faculty at WSU in 1998 after receiving his Ph.D. from Michigan State University. Professor Doom has been privileged to be recognized with many of the highest faculty honors bestowed by his Professional Society (IEEE-CS 2018 Computer Science and Engineering Teaching Award), Wright State Administration (2020 Fredrick A. White Distinguished Professor of Professional Service, 2018 Trustees Award for Faculty Excellence, 2014 Robert J. Kegerreis Distinguished Professor of Teaching), Students (student-selected teaching awards, 2016-2017 Student Government Association Faculty Member of the year), and Faculty (2019 Faculty Senate Resolution) for his contributions to the University's mission.  In 2025, Dr. Doom anticipates being granted the lifetime rank of Emeritus Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Wright State University.

**ON TEACHING**: Dr. Doom would not mind being remembered as someone who spent "too much effort" on his teaching. Dr. Doom is an internationally recognized educator and was awarded the IEEE-CS 2018 Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Award, "for tremendous contributions to Computer Science and Engineering through a balanced career incorporating research, mentoring of students, curriculum and pedagogy development, and service". He has been honored with WSU's top teaching award and the position Robert J. Kegerris Distinguished Professor of Teaching (2014-2017), was awarded an Outstanding Engineers and Scientists' Award (Education) by the Affiliate Societies Council of Dayton (2015), and was a Southern Ohio Council for Higher Education's (SOCHE) awardee for Excellence in Teaching (2014). Dr. Doom served on the Faculty Advisory Board for WSU's Center for Teaching and Learning (2014-2016) and regularly shares teaching techniques developed through formal training activities including the Ohio Teacher's Excellence Program (OTEP, 2001), the National Effective Teaching Institute (NETI, 2002), and AAC&U's Teaching to Increase Diversity and Equity in STEM (TIDES, 2015-2018) programs.  Dr. Doom is a many-time recipient of WSU's student-determined College of Engineering Excellence in Teaching award. Dr. Doom disseminates his educational work through venues including the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), the ACM special interest group on computer science education (SIGCSE), IEEE Transactions on Education, and contributions to textbooks. His teaching interests include both undergraduate and graduate STEM courses, particularly undergraduate courses in digital design, computer organization, and computer programming.

**ON UNIVERSITY-LEVEL LEADERSHIP/SERVICE**: Dr. Doom serves as the Associate Dean for WSU's College of Engineering and Computer Science (2019-2025) after first serving five years as Associate Chair for the Department of Computer Science & Engineering (2014-2019).  He recently was awarded the title of Frederick A. White Distinguished University Professor of Professional Service. Professor Doom has served in University-level Faculty governance since 2005, including as Faculty President (2017-2019), Vice President (2016-2017), Faculty Senate Executive Committee (2011-2015, 2016-2019), as co-chair of the Faculty governance committee (2022-2024), as chair of the ad-hoc Faculty Senate Committee on Student Success (2011-2012), as chair of the ad-hoc Faculty Senate committee on Information Technology Integration and Effectiveness (2012-2013), as chair or the Executive Steering Committee for Information Technology (2013), as chair of the University Academic Policies Committee (2013-2014, co-chair 2016-2017), and as co-chair of the ad hoc Faculty Senate General Education core review committee (2014-2015). Dr. Doom has also served the University Faculty through leadership roles on the Executive Committee of the Wright State Chapter of the American Associate of University Professors (2005-2010), and as chair of the University Academic Integrity Hearing Panel (2006-2008).

**ON RESEARCH**: Professor Doom pursues research in the fields of undergraduate engineering education, digital/computer systems, and data science. His education research focuses on the impact of active learning and culturally relevant teaching on student success in STEM. He applies computational and statistical techniques to identify, retrieve, classify, simulate, characterize, and analyze data from a variety of domains. Much of his research involves the analysis of biological data, including raw instrumentation data, as well as processed genomic sequence, protein sequence, metabolite, or population data. Notable research includes techniques for forensic DNA analysis (cited by the U.S. Supreme Court), improved quantification techniques and Kernel-based binning methods for NMR spectroscopic data, isolation and visualization of translational efficiency biases, characterization and synthesis of 1H NMR spectroscopic data, and knowledge discovery in large biological data sets. He served as chair for the IEEE Task Force (Technical Committee) on Bioinformatics 2007-2009. Dr. Doom has advised graduate research in the Computer Science (PhD and MS), Computer Engineering (PhD and MS), Electrical Engineering (MS), and Biomedical Sciences (PhD) programs at WSU.

**ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION**: Dr. Doom is committed to fully developing and utilizing the talents of every colleague and student.  As a first-generation college student, he deeply understands the critical role that the advice and support of faculty/peers/supervisors play in allowing everyone to thrive and be valued in new/different environments. His formal DEI work includes research on innovation in STEM education to lift all students, with a focus on teaching methods that facilitate response to cultural, ability-based, or gender-identity-based barriers.  These efforts have resulted in the investment of hundreds of thousands of dollars of competitive external funding and have been disseminated in a variety of venues, including as a chapter in "Culturally responsive strategies for reforming STEM Higher Education" (2019, Mack et al).  Dr. Doom was a WSU Equity Academy Champion for the 2022-2023 academic year and supervises the ASEE Deans' Diversity Initiatives at Wright State University.

**ON OUTREACH**: In the field of data science, Dr. Doom has served as an expert witness in depositions and in-person for courts ranging from the local to Federal level. The results of his studies on forensic DNA data have been used to promote justice in courts throughout the world. His work/opinions in have been disseminated in a variety of archival venues ranging from those for engineers (IEEE Transactions on Education, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology), for forensic and data scientists (Journal of Forensic Science, Jurimetrics), for legal advocates (The Champion), and for scientists in general (Science). Dr. Doom is a founding partner of Forensic Bioinformatics Services, Inc. - a company devoted to promoting social justice through the automated and objective evaluation of forensic data.  Dr. Doom also serves as a Program Evaluator for both the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET.
